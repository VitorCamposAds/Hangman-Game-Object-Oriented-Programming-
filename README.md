# Hangman-Game-Object-Oriented-Programming-
Hangman Game implemented using object-oriented programming. It randomly selects a word, clears the screen, and displays a hangman board. The user guesses letters until they win or lose. The program uses a Hangman class to handle letter guessing and game status. It prints the outcome (win or lose) and the correct word.
